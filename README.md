![printprocess](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f0eeb4-acfe-40e5-a2db-4edd8781d27b)

This guide provides detailed steps to fabricate Cheerios-inspired devices that are 3D printable and designed to operate on the surface of water.

The information provided is from the current preprint: Wilt, J. K., Schramma, N., Bottermans, J. W., & Jalaal, M. (2024). "ActiveCheerios: 3D-Printed Marangoni-Driven Active Particles at an Interface." arXiv preprint arXiv:2411.16011.

## Materials and Equipment ##

**3D Printer:** Ultimaker S3 fused filament fabrication (FFF) machine. 

**Printing Material: **Polylactic acid (PLA) thermoplastic. In this study, red PLA was used, but any color is suitable. PLA is moderately biodegradable (under certain conditions), and other biodegradable materials are recommended for environmental considerations. Alternative materials can be used while considering their density; biodegradable options are preferred for environmental sustainability.

## File Formats and Designs ##

Single-hole outlet design (predominantly used in the study)

Chiral device (predominantly used in the study)

Two-outlet design and other exploratory designs for customization. File Formats: STL (Stereolithography): For direct 3D printing. STEP: For importing into CAD programs, allowing further customization and dimension extraction.

## Printing Settings ##

Load the STL or STEP file into your slicing software. Choose the desired layer refinement level (preferably ultra-fine). Begin the printing process. Post-processing: Inspect the printed device. Use a fine needle to clear any blockages in the hole(s) caused by layer inaccuracies.

**Infill:** Approximately 10%. Ensures sufficient buoyancy and structural rigidity. Reduces errors during printing, especially for long spans. 

**Layer height:** Ultra-fine settings for high precision. Any refinement level is viable but may require post-processing because the hole may become blocked, which can be manually fixed by clearing the outlet with a needle. 

**Typical Print Time:** 15â€“20 minutes per device, depending on settings.


## Notes for Users ##

Exploration and Customization: The additional designs not included in the study are provided for further experimentation. STEP files allow users to modify dimensions and adapt designs in CAD software. Environmental Responsibility: If using non-PLA materials, consider their environmental impact and compatibility with water-based operation. By following these instructions, you can successfully fabricate and experiment with Cheerios-inspired devices for use on water surfaces. Adjust and innovate based on your specific needs and applications!
